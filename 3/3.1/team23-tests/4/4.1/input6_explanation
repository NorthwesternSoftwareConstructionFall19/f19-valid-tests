1. LINE 1-67
TESTING violation for "Must be right player's turn"

violation
- Say Boards = [B1, B2, B3] in the order of most recent to least recent
- From B2, B3, we infer it's black's turn to place going from B2 -> B1.
But B1 has one more white stone instead of black stone. So violation occurs

2. LINE 69-135

TESTING violation for "Must be right player's turn"

Violation
- B3->B2 white stone placed. B2->B1 black stone placed.
- Therefore, B1->Current must be white's turn, but in the example it's black's
turn. VIOLATION of "Must be right player's turn"
